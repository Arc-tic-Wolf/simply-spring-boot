# Simply Spring Boot

First time working with Spring Boot.

### Tested on Ubuntu machine, make sure java version 11 is installed and intellij idea is configured for spring boot.

### Build project first on ide and then use gui or terminal as follows
```
cd dummy
./gradlew bootRun
```

### On browser or Postman, go to this url to see the generated message 
```
http://localhost:8080
```
### Setup a PostgreSQL database on a virtual machine. Use JPA and hibernate to connect successfully.

```
http://localhost:8080/clients
```

### Here the dummy database table's contents will be displayed on browser in JSON format.
